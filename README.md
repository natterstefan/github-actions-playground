# Github Actions Playground

## GitHub Actions Security

- [GitHub Actions: Control permissions for GITHUB_TOKEN | GitHub Changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-04-20-github-actions-control-permissions-for-github_token/)
- [Automatic token authentication - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#permissions-for-the-github_token)
- [step-security/secure-workflows: Secure GitHub Actions CI/CD workflows via automated remediations](https://github.com/step-security/secure-workflows)
- ATTENTION: `pull_request_target`: "For workflows that are triggered by the
  `pull_request_target` event, the `GITHUB_TOKEN` is granted read/write
  repository permission unless the permissions key is specified and the workflow
  can access secrets, even when it is triggered from a fork.
  ([src](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull_request_target))
